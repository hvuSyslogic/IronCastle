	/// <para>
	/// ISIS-MTT PROFILE: The relatively complex structure of AdmissionSyntax
	/// supports the following concepts and requirements:
	/// <ul>
	/// <li> External institutions (e.g. professional associations, chambers, unions,
	/// administrative bodies, companies, etc.), which are responsible for granting
	/// and verifying professional admissions, are indicated by means of the data
	/// field admissionAuthority. An admission authority is indicated by a
	/// GeneralName object. Here an X.501 directory name (distinguished name) can be
	/// indicated in the field directoryName, a URL address can be indicated in the
	/// field uniformResourceIdentifier, and an object identifier can be indicated in
	/// the field registeredId.
	/// <li> The names of authorities which are responsible for the administration of
	/// title registers are indicated in the data field namingAuthority. The name of
	/// the authority can be identified by an object identifier in the field
	/// namingAuthorityId, by means of a text string in the field
	/// namingAuthorityText, by means of a URL address in the field
	/// namingAuthorityUrl, or by a combination of them. For example, the text string
	/// can contain the name of the authority, the country and the name of the title
	/// register. The URL-option refers to a web page which contains lists with
	/// �officially� registered professions (text and possibly OID) as well as
	/// further information on these professions. Object identifiers for the
	/// component namingAuthorityId are grouped under the OID-branch
	/// id-isis-at-namingAuthorities and must be applied for.
	/// <li>See
	/// http://www.teletrust.de/anwend.asp?Id=30200&amp;Sprache=E_&amp;HomePG=0 for
	/// an application form and http://www.teletrust.de/links.asp?id=30220,11
	/// for an overview of registered naming authorities.
	/// <li> By means of the data type ProfessionInfo certain professions,
	/// specializations, disciplines, fields of activity, etc. are identified. A
	/// profession is represented by one or more text strings, resp. profession OIDs
	/// in the fields professionItems and professionOIDs and by a registration number
	/// in the field registrationNumber. An indication in text form must always be
	/// present, whereas the other indications are optional. The component
	/// addProfessionInfo may contain additional applicationspecific information in
	/// DER-encoded form.
	/// </ul>
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// By means of different namingAuthority-OIDs or profession OIDs hierarchies of
	/// professions, specializations, disciplines, fields of activity, etc. can be
	/// expressed. The issuing admission authority should always be indicated (field
	/// admissionAuthority), whenever a registration number is presented. Still,
	/// information on admissions can be given without indicating an admission or a
	/// naming authority by the exclusive use of the component professionItems. In
	/// this case the certification authority is responsible for the verification of
	/// the admission information.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// This attribute is single-valued. Still, several admissions can be captured in
	/// the sequence structure of the component contentsOfAdmissions of
	/// AdmissionSyntax or in the component professionInfos of Admissions. The
	/// component admissionAuthority of AdmissionSyntax serves as default value for
	/// the component admissionAuthority of Admissions. Within the latter component
	/// the default value can be overwritten, in case that another authority is
	/// responsible. The component namingAuthority of Admissions serves as a default
	/// value for the component namingAuthority of ProfessionInfo. Within the latter
	/// component the default value can be overwritten, in case that another naming
	/// authority needs to be recorded.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The length of the string objects is limited to 128 characters. It is
	/// recommended to indicate a namingAuthorityURL in all issued attribute
	/// certificates. If a namingAuthorityURL is indicated, the field professionItems
	/// of ProfessionInfo should contain only registered titles. If the field
	/// professionOIDs exists, it has to contain the OIDs of the professions listed
	/// in professionItems in the same order. In general, the field professionInfos
	/// should contain only one entry, unless the admissions that are to be listed
	/// are logically connected (e.g. they have been issued under the same admission
	/// number).
